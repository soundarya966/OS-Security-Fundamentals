# Task 2 – Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux & Windows)

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand operating system–level security concepts and apply basic OS hardening techniques using Linux/Windows.

## Operating System Used
Ubuntu/Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)

## Tools Used
- VirtualBox
- Ubuntu Linux
- Kali Linux
- UFW Firewall
- Linux terminal commands

## Tasks Performed
- Installed and configured Ubuntu Linux in a virtual machine
- Explored user accounts and access control mechanisms
- Studied Linux file permissions using chmod, chown, and ls -l
- Understood the difference between root and normal users
- Enabled and configured UFW firewall
- Identified running processes and services
- Disabled unnecessary services to reduce attack surface
- Documented OS hardening best practices

## Key Learnings
- Importance of OS hardening
- Role of least privilege principle
- How file permissions improve system security
- Why unnecessary services increase security risks

## Outcome
This task improved my understanding of OS-level security, access control, and system hardening practices.
